## SDL 3 GPU template with CMake and vcpkg
sdl3-ttf, sdl3-image, sdl3-ttf and glm are also included!
Just clone with submodules, bootstrap vcpkg if your IDE doesn't do it automatically, use CMakePresets or let your IDE do it. Profit!
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/CodesOtakuYT/codotaku_sdl.git
```
